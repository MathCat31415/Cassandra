# Cassandra

--- Due to Time Issues this project is for now suspended ---

Someday Cassandra wants to grow to a Computer Algebra Library. Yes I know, there are a lot of different CAS already in the net. But Cassandra wants to be able to do one thing, I have not seen with any of the already existent ones. It wants to be able to calculate in any given Environment. By that I mean, that if you want it to calculate in a unique group, ring, Algebra, vector-space, Cassandra should be able to do it. (At least if you specify it well enough.) It should also be able to simplify given statements if you provide it with the rules for all (or at least some) of the used operators and functions (for example commutativity).

With that said you will recognize that Cassandra is really just a Baby ;) I don't even know whether what I want is possible (for me) or even if it is useful. If you have any suggestions what so ever, or any Ideas of Improvements you are welcome to tell me. If you think this project is worth the effort (or otherwise) please tell me...

I think, I have said anything I wanted to say. I am looking forward to any feedback, thanks in advance
